It was hauled by a rotary steam engine imported from England and was used for ferrying granite\r\nThe Madras Railway was established in 1845 and the Great Indian Peninsular Railway was incorporated in 1849.[6] Temporary railway lines were built such as the railway line at Dowleswaram built by Arthur Cotton to supply stone for the construction of a dam over the Godavari River in 1845 and the Solani aqueduct railway, built by Proby Cautley in Roorkee to transport construction materials for an aqueduct over the Solani river in 1851.[6] In 1852, a steam locomotive imported from England was tried at Byculla.[8] In 1853, the first passenger train on 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge ran for 34 kilometres (21 mi) between Bombay and Thane which had 14-carriages carrying 400 people, hauled by three steam locomotives: the Sahib, Sindh and Sultan.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3097, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7b6b7ad-c464-49fc-9b4f-93635a6779a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7b6b7ad-c464-49fc-9b4f-93635a6779a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\prabh\\srijan\\QA_llamaindex_geminiAPI_embedding\\Data\\indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_name": "indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29199, "creation_date": "2024-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2659bd0c-79c8-4322-8345-a86a6eea475a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\prabh\\srijan\\QA_llamaindex_geminiAPI_embedding\\Data\\indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_name": "indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29199, "creation_date": "2024-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-22"}, "hash": "8a1f110e3931a93c9b1b0cda48910ee52dd8c32b51ea1b830bf54e71bb6857d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf44c322-0a53-4eaf-85fb-96e8d4978df1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\prabh\\srijan\\QA_llamaindex_geminiAPI_embedding\\Data\\indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_name": "indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29199, "creation_date": "2024-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-22"}, "hash": "59b21f92a39582bc09956e2723e6ddf7a891dca4068018b9453afb67b8c86f01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b1efb80-913e-48d4-9d41-2e808e77f62f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1919c35e38a66ecf5845f6d4a9d4fc655e0b39db383d0c3643f6f1f3ec122f78", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[9][10] This day is considered to be the formation date of the Indian Railways and is marked as the Indian Railways day annually.[11][12]\r\n\r\nThe Thane viaducts, the first railway bridges, were built over the Thane creek when the Mumbai-Thane line was extended to Kalyan in May 1854.

1874, a horse-drawn tramway began operation in Bombay between Colaba and Parel.[15] In 1879, the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was established which built railway lines across the then Hyderabad State from Kachiguda.[16] In 1877, an Ajmer built F-1/734 Steam Locomotive became the first indigenously built locomotive in India.[17] In 1897, lighting in passenger coaches was introduced with

55,000 km (34,000 mi) tracks across the country.[22][23] These railway companies were amalgamated in steps to form a single entity named as Indian Railways.[24] In December 1950, the Central Advisory Committee for Railways approved the plan for re-organizing Indian Railways into six regional zones with the Southern (14 April 1951), Central (5 November 1951), and Western (5 November 1951) zones being the first to be created.[23][25][21] In 1952, fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in passenger trains and sleeping accommodations were introduced in coaches.[6] The first diesel locomotive used in India was fabricated by North British Locomotive Company in 1954.\r\n\r\nThe first locomotive manufacturing unit at Chittaranjan was commissioned in 1950.[27] The first rail coaches were manufactured in India from 1956 when the Integral Coach Factory was established at Madras.[28] In 1956, the first air-conditioned train plied between Howrah and New Delhi.[29] In 1957, Indian

The Indian Railways website went online in February 2000 and online ticketing was introduced on 3 August 2002 through IRCTC.[37] Indian Railways now provides multiple channels for passengers to book tickets through website, smartphone apps, SMS, rail reservation counters at train stations, or through private ticket booking counters. Reserved tickets may be booked up to 60 days in advance and confirmed reservation tickets will show the passenger and fare details along with berth or seat number(s) allocated to them on the ticket.\r\n\r\nIn case of no confirmed reservation, a wait-list number is assigned and wait-listed tickets get confirmed if there are cancellations of already reserved tickets. Reservation against cancellation tickets is an intermediate category between the waiting and confirmed lists in sleeper classes which allows a ticket holder to board the train and share a berth.[167] Reserved tickets can be booked by passengers who want to travel at short notice at higher fares through the Tatkal train ticket, where no refund is applicable on cancellation.[168] A valid proof for the purchase of ticket along with photo identification is required to board the train.[169] Unreserved tickets for short distance or unplanned travels may be purchased at stations or through UTS mobile app at any time before departure.[170] Holders of such tickets may only board the general or unreserved coaches.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18783, "end_char_idx": 22217, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b52760a0-0321-41f9-b365-5a9afa36e165": {"__data__": {"id_": "b52760a0-0321-41f9-b365-5a9afa36e165", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\prabh\\srijan\\QA_llamaindex_geminiAPI_embedding\\Data\\indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_name": "indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29199, "creation_date": "2024-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2659bd0c-79c8-4322-8345-a86a6eea475a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\prabh\\srijan\\QA_llamaindex_geminiAPI_embedding\\Data\\indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_name": "indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29199, "creation_date": "2024-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-22"}, "hash": "8a1f110e3931a93c9b1b0cda48910ee52dd8c32b51ea1b830bf54e71bb6857d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6533fc1f-3f64-40c0-8549-9b328b1a3115", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\prabh\\srijan\\QA_llamaindex_geminiAPI_embedding\\Data\\indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_name": "indian_railway_gyankosh.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 29199, "creation_date": "2024-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-22"}, "hash": "af6cccd47e9beea2d72549c21b94de747a5843a79488bd34adc7e76854d0ebf2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "12edc302-9338-488d-b91f-3920ea3c0c43", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66fec9ad56113db58a3085675dbc7f1ed7b9552867fe85d58fd5210f7e2848ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[170] Holders of such tickets may only board the general or unreserved coaches.
